## **üõ† Key Components**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Analysis**
- **Database Setup**: Created and queried a relational database to extract insights.  
- **Key Insights Extracted**:
  - Total Loan Applications
  - Total Funded Amount
  - Total Amount Received
  - Average Interest Rate
  - Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
- **SQL Techniques**: Used `GROUP BY`, `PARTITION BY`, `CTE`, and date functions.
